The file "2020CS50426.cpp" is the file that houses all the functions.
It can be operated using the "make" from the "Makefile" as follows

1) Direct the terminal to the directory containing these 2 files.
2) Type "make" to compile the file and get the executable file "yourcode.out"
3) Then, input whatever files you may want and whatever operation you may want to perform on them.
4) If the files are found, and the data they contain are compatible, the output file is created. If not, we exit gracefully.

Thank you!
